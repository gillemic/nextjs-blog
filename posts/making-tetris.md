Making the tetris game was a lot harder than I expected! I ended up having to learn several React lifecycle methods such as **ComponentDidMount()** and **ComponentWillUnmount()**, it
definitely made me think more about the step by step process of creating the new board, updating the board as the game progresses, and what to do when the game is over. I hope to create more
games and really flush out the `games/` page of this website!
