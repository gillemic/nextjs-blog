Over the last few months, I've been practicing my Python skills using **Project Euler**, an archive of challenging problems meant to be solved using algorithms made in the
programming language of one's choice. I am now around problem 41, and the problems only keep getting tougher. I've been using a functional approach to the problems as well, because sometimes I like to use functions from past problems such as the prime number generator based on the Sieve of Erosthenes algorithm. The most recent problem involved me using the prime number generator to get all primes below 10,000,000, and then using that list to find the highest prime that contains digits 1-n **once**, the max result turned out to be 7652413.
